# FdF project for 42Madrid

This is the first graphical project at 42, focused on representing a landscape as a 3D object.  
All surfaces are drawn using lines in a **wireframe model**, with the help of the 42 school's graphical library: **MiniLibX**.  
This internal library provides the basic tools to open a window, create images, and handle keyboard/mouse events.

# üåç MY PROJECT

I created my own custom map for the project, called **`my_map.fdf`**, based on an imaginary topographic landscape generated with the help of AI.

I also implemented the bonus part of the project, which includes a **control panel** displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.  
The controls were programmed using **key hooks** and include:

- Zoom In / Zoom Out  
- Move the map  
- Rotate on the X, Y, and Z axes  
- Switch between bird's eye view and isometric view  
- Reset the view  
- Hide the control panel

# üß© PROJECT STEPS

## V.1 Rendering

Your program must represent the model using isometric projection.  
The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a `.fdf` file passed as an argument.

**Example**:

``` bash
$> cat 42.fdf
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 10 10 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0
0 0 10 10 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 0 0
0 0 10 10 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 0 0
0 0 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 0 0 0
0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Each number represents a point in 3D space:
- The horizontal position corresponds to its **X** axis
- The vertical position corresponds to its **Y** axis
- The value corresponds to its **altitude (Z axis)**

---

## V.2 Graphic Management

- Your program must display the image in a window.  
- Switching between windows or minimizing must not crash the program.  
- Pressing **ESC** should close the window and exit cleanly.  
- Clicking the close button (‚ùå) should also exit cleanly.  
- Use of **MiniLibX image functions** is mandatory.

---

## V.3 Bonus Features

Extra points are awarded for implementing:
- An extra projection (e.g., parallel or conic)  
- Zoom functionality  
- Translation (map movement)  
- Rotation  
- Any additional feature of your choice

# ‚öôÔ∏è HOW TO USE

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agn3shayd3n/fdf42.git
```
Navigate to the MiniLibX directory and compile:

```bash
cd minilibx_macos
make
```
Return to the main directory and compile the project:

```bash
cd ..
make
```
Run the program using a sample map from the maps folder:

```bash
./fdf maps/t1.fdf
```
Or use the custom map I created:
```bash
./fdf my_map.fdf
```
Use the following controls to interact with the map:
```
--- CONTROLS ---
Z / X       ‚Üí Zoom in / out
Arrows      ‚Üí Move map
Q / E       ‚Üí Rotate X axis
W / S       ‚Üí Rotate Y axis
R / L       ‚Üí Rotate Z axis
B           ‚Üí Switch view
Backspace   ‚Üí Reset view
H           ‚Üí Toggle control panel
```
